# Note
This is an english translation for the 6.2 server of GameCoast Aion, but it might also work with other servers.

If anything is wrong with the translation you can open an issue or make a pull request. I didn't test the translation for the class selection quests, so please notify me if it's broken.

# Install
If you already have the 6.0 translation by lmfaoown you should uninstall it cause it may interfere with these files.

Step 1: Click the Releases button
